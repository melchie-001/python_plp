## 1. 📋 List Input and Sum Calculator

**Objective:**  
Write a program that accepts user input to create a list of integers. Then, compute and display the sum of all the integers in the list.

**Skills Practiced:**  
- User input  
- List creation  
- Looping or `sum()` function

**Extension Ideas:**  
- Validate input to ensure only integers are added  
- Display the average or maximum value  
- Allow the user to add numbers until they type "done"

## 2. 📚 Tuple of Favorite Books

**Objective:**  
Create a tuple containing the names of five of your favorite books. Then, use a `for` loop to print each book name on a separate line.

**Skills Practiced:**  
- Tuples  
- Looping through sequences  
- String formatting

**Extension Ideas:**  
- Add numbering to each book  
- Ask the user to rate each book  
- Store the tuple in a file for future reference

## 3. 🧑 Dictionary for Personal Info

**Objective:**  
Write a program that uses a dictionary to store information about a person, such as their name, age, and favorite color. Ask the user for input and store the information in the dictionary. Then, print the dictionary to the console.

**Skills Practiced:**  
- Dictionaries  
- User input  
- Key-value storage

**Extension Ideas:**  
- Add more fields like hobby, location, or favorite food  
- Format the output as a mini bio  
- Save the dictionary to a JSON file

## 4. 🔗 Set Intersection Finder

**Objective:**  
Write a program that accepts user input to create two sets of integers. Then, create a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.

**Skills Practiced:**  
- Sets  
- User input  
- Set operations (`intersection`)

**Extension Ideas:**  
- Display elements unique to each set  
- Use set union or difference  
- Allow repeated comparisons in a loop

## 5. ✂️ List Comprehension with Word Filter

**Objective:**  
Create a program that stores a list of words. Then, use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the words that have an odd number of characters.

**Skills Practiced:**  
- Lists  
- List comprehension  
- String length filtering

**Extension Ideas:**  
- Ask the user to input the words  
- Display both the original and filtered lists  
- Sort the filtered list alphabetically

## 🌟 Bonus Challenge

Try combining these projects into a single interactive app where the user can choose which data structure to explore. You can use a menu system and loop to keep the program running until the user exits.
